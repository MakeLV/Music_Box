Music Box
=========

This sketch uses (at a minimum) a speaker, a resistor and a button pad to play music as selected by the button pushed. Be cautious about hooking a speaker up to your Arduino. You could potentially draw enough power to break an Arduino, or so I've been told.

Uses the Tone and Keypad library. I believe the tone library comes with the Arduino IDE. The keypad library is available in the Arduino Playground:
